<hr />
<br>
Thremulation Station is an approachable small-scale threat emulation and detection range. Use Prelude Operator to **emulate** threats, and the Elastic Endpoint Agent to **detect**.

> **TL;DR** If you're ready to skip the reading and jump into things, head to the [Quickstart / Installation](https://docs.thremulation.io/quickstart/installation/) section.


## Project Goals

Our goal are to provide a local environment that:

1. Can operate on a laptop with a _minimum_ of 4 threads and 8G of RAM
1. Supports the big 3 host operating systems (initial linux path is RHEL-based)
1. Gives users a smooth path to execute threats and observe them with Elastic


## Disclaimer

Thremulation Station is a great environment to experiment and learn security techniques, but should not be 
considered a full-featured malware sandbox. _Know what you're doing, break it, you buy it._
